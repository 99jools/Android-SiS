Key generation and sharing currently done from PC rather than android device 
Folder management and sharing done outside of app - could be added but may require switching to a more complex dropbox api.  Cost-benefit analysis

Early design considerations 
• who generates keys
• how are keys generated
• how are keys distributed
• issue with public key - how would we stop Mallory uploading bogus documents
• issue with where to place trust
• how to manage letting decryption know group - flirted with shared preferences
Issue: if generate [rivate key on device, it is device specific - ability to import would allow same keystores to be used on multiple devices for4 same user
• decision to ignore considerations like battery life and 
User authentication and need to block after failed attempts
• large files
• network connectivity
• battery life
• small memory
• multithreading for gui
• where to encrypt
• model to use for file distribution and storage
Means of distributing certificates is outside of scope - as these are public, any means will do.
